The piano is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard. It is one of
the most popular instruments in the world. Widely used in classical and jazz
music for solo performances, ensemble use, chamber music and accompaniment,
the piano is also very popular as an aid to composing and rehearsal. Although
not portable and often expensive, the piano's versatility and ubiquity have
made it one of the world's most familiar musical instruments.
Pressing a key on the piano's keyboard causes a felt-covered hammer to strike
steel strings. The hammers rebound, allowing the strings to continue vibrating
at their resonant frequency. These vibrations are transmitted through a
bridge to a sounding board that more efficiently couples the acoustic energy
to the air. The sound would otherwise be no louder than that directly produced
by the strings. When the key is released, a damper stops the string's
vibration. See the article on Piano key frequencies for a picture of the piano
keyboard and the location of middle-C. In the Hornbostel-Sachs system of
instrument classification, pianos are considered chordophones.
